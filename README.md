#  Analyzing Urban Air Quality: A Data-Driven Study of PM2.5 Levels in Beijing

##  Project Overview
Air pollution is a major environmental and public health concern in urban areas.  
This project analyzes **PM2.5 air pollution levels in Beijing** using historical air quality and meteorological data to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and influencing factors.

The analysis follows a complete **data analytics lifecycle** including data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insight generation.

##  Key Insights
- PM2.5 levels are highest during winter months.
- Higher wind speeds help reduce pollution levels.
- Pollution peaks during late-night and early-morning hours.
- Lower temperatures are associated with higher PM2.5 concentrations.
- Extreme pollution events occur frequently, indicating health risks.
